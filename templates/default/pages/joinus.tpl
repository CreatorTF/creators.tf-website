      <p>Your main role is to create assets. Logos, banners, graphic elements, images and so on. You will work in direct contact with the team, creating new assets, their variations or visually and technically improving existing ones.
If you choose this role, be sure to leave a couple of links to your existing portfolio so that we can evaluate your potential.</p>

      <p>Your role is to create balanced, interesting concepts for weapons. You'll need to evaluate the way these weapons work in multiple game situations; they should not only be fun and interesting to play with, but should also be fun and
        interesting to play against. While not required, we are much more likely to hire people with competitive experience. If you have competitive experience, please leave references to events or forums you've participated in.</p>

      <p>Good experiences need good sounds. If a weapon shoots in a certain way, there should be a corrosponding sound, right? Your goal is to create/modify sounds that will bring depth to what is happening on the screen. While we mainly need sounds
        for weapons, we have plenty of other sound-related needs.</p>
